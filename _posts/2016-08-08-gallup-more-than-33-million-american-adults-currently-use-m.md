  A new Gallup poll out today finds that percent of American adults who say they
  currently smoke marijuana has nearly doubled over the past three years. In
  2013, only 7 percent of adults said they were marijuana smokers. When Gallup
  asked again in July of this year, 13 percent admitted to current marijuana
  use.
